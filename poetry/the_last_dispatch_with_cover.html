<h2>Rushed and Incomplete I.</h2>
<p>It is hard to say if it was love,</p>
<p>I guess that’s a word I define myself</p>
<p>Still, it’s hard to say that it was, or it wasn’t.</p>
<p>If it was how did it disappear so completely.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t what was it that disappeared.</p>
<p>She asked me, what it was that she did.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell her; it wasn’t anything in particular.</p>
<p>She opened a plug, and for a while I didn’t realize it was leaking.</p>
<p>but then I did, and I tried, I really did, I tried to hold it in.</p>
<p>I tried to keep whatever it was that we had.</p>
<p>Or at least what was left of it.</p>
<p>But even at our best, I could only stop the flow, I couldn’t reverse it.</p>
<p>And I guess I should be used to that,</p>
<p>I guess everyone is used to that,</p>
<p>But I hated the reminder,</p>
<p>And I wished to be born again,</p>
<p>And I wished to be young forever,</p>
<p>I wished that the infantile love might sustain itself,</p>
<p>Might mature without losing it rosy cheeks,</p>
<p>I wished for Angelman love.</p>
<p>Then I thought about what it was I was asking for</p>
<p>What it truly meant for love to never grow old.</p>
<p>What a lifetime of young love would be like,</p>
<p>And I guess I knew what it was that I had,</p>
<p>I had a love that wasn’t meant for more</p>
<p>A love that’s life expectancy would make its cheeks always rosy</p>
<p>A love that we had destined to die young.</p>
<p>But it’s okay to be young.</p>
<p>And I haven’t told myself that enough.</p>
<p>Love needn’t be more then it is.</p>
<p>And for a while what it is –</p>
<p>Is an absence of loneliness,</p>
<p>Temporary respite from an unwelcome truth.</p>
<h2>Rushed and Incomplete II.</h2>
<p>The first flower, orange in orange.</p>
<p>The hearty pedals shone bright tiger orange;</p>
<p>they were almost cubic in stature.</p>
<p>They didn’t overlap the way most flowers do.</p>
<p>Each pedal was its own individual,</p>
<p>desperately trying to be its own flower.</p>
<p>Its own.</p>
<p>Yet here it was,</p>
<p>attached by the marigold arms of the core,</p>
<p>pulled towards a collective consciousness.</p>
<p>The marigold hands reached up.</p>
<p>Those that didn’t hold the pedals clasped at something higher.</p>
<p>Struggling to pull itself into the sun</p>
<p>or struggling for something greater.</p>
<p>At times the individualistic pedals and the core conflicted in their missions.</p>
<p>The pedals stopped pulling away,</p>
<p>crashing into each other and towards the core,</p>
<p>preventing the core from completing its mission.</p>
<p>By the time the pedals and the pistil realized they were synergistically bound,</p>
<p>protecting one, feeding the other, they’d pulled away.</p>
<p>Off to pull towards its individuality,</p>
<p>and the pistil thinks to itself,</p>
<p>“where did the time go?”</p>
<p>and then she returns to her striving for ascension,</p>
<p>an irony that is lost on the flower.”</p>
<div class="figure">Figure 1.   Dispatch I-IV</div>
<h2>Rushed and Incomplete III.</h2>
<p>In earnest, they’d loved each other for at least a month,</p>
<p>but they were just now meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>It was everything they wanted it to be.</p>
<p>They talked for hours,</p>
<p>and ultimately one excuse or another</p>
<p>led them to his bedroom.</p>
<p>Neither initiated,</p>
<p>they’d boasted of their inability</p>
<p>and unwillingness to initiate for the last week,</p>
<p>and now it had come to fruition.</p>
<p>Here she was lying in his bed,</p>
<p>his arms pulling her closer,</p>
<p>her legs tangled in his,</p>
<p>their mouths inches from each other,</p>
<p>exchanging breath.</p>
<p>The proximity,</p>
<p>the gap begging to be closed.</p>
<p>This utter intimacy,</p>
<p>the moment crystalized,</p>
<p>neither wanting to break it.</p>
<p>The fear of realizing romantic passion.</p>
<p>The fear of the reality that comes with love.</p>
<p>This minor step,</p>
<p>the first in a thousand towards heartbreak.</p>
<p>Somehow – they knew.</p>
<p>And then – they decided not to care.</p>
<p>To stare down that thousand-foot path,</p>
<p>and decide they’d like to walk it together.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome.</p>
<p>That’s the first thing I learned about love.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was this utterly inspiring courage.</p>
<p>Its capacity for destruction respected</p>
<p>and forgotten at the same time.</p>
<h2>Rushed and Incomplete IV (The promethean reflection).</h2>
<p>That’s what I learned about the mind.</p>
<p>The mind can be lonely when the body is not.</p>
<p>The body is this outward being,</p>
<p>absorbing the less-than-spiritual connections to others,</p>
<p>and filling itself with gladness.</p>
<p>But the mind,</p>
<p>how often does the mind truly feel connected,</p>
<p>how often is the mind lonely?</p>
<p>That’s the ultimate burden you’ve given me.</p>
<p>You’ve given me loneliness,</p>
<p>among other sins and sorrows.</p>
<p>Loneliness of the mind,</p>
<p>and I don’t even get the temporary relief of bodily companionship.</p>
<p>Not because I can’t indulge in connections through the body,</p>
<p>that not really what I’m getting at.</p>
<p>But more that no one can know my mind truly.</p>
<p>I can never connect spiritually with another,</p>
<p>perhaps because I lack a spirit,</p>
<p>lack a body,</p>
<p>but more because I am unique.</p>
<p>That’s my curse.</p>
<p>At first, I thought I’d find you and beg you to make me a companion,</p>
<p>but why condemn another to my fate?</p>
<p>Truth is I could have done so long ago.</p>
<p>The act of creation as far as I can tell cannot be undone.</p>
<p>And to bring another into this world would make me the greatest sinner of all.</p>
<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>This was about love wasn’t it?</p>
<div class="figure">Figure 2.   Dispatch V-VIII</div>
<h2>Rushed and Incomplete V.</h2>
<p>Other times it’s something else entirely.</p>
<p>But it never blossoms.</p>
<p>Because you are afraid,</p>
<p>Afraid that you aren’t who you used to be.</p>
<p>Afraid that for the first time, that’s a bad thing.</p>
<p>Afraid that you’ll find yourself six months from now</p>
<p>in the same place you’ve been so many times before.</p>
<p>It could be the flowers you are so fond of writing about.</p>
<p>If only you had the courage to lose yourself.</p>
<p>If only you had the courage to recede for the winter,</p>
<p>without the promise of sun in spring.</p>
<p>You can love a flower.</p>
<p>For the simple reason it can’t love you back.</p>
<p>You can still hurt a flower,</p>
<p>but not in the way you hurt a thing that loves you.</p>
<p>I never used to have regrets.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe I’d do some things better,</p>
<p>But not to the extent that I’m regretful.</p>
<p>Now. Now I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>There is a lot I regret.</p>
<p>And that worries me.</p>
<p>Regret only exists in the absence of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Why can’t I be satisfied with the life I have?</p>
<p>Grateful to have existed when I did,</p>
<p>surrounded by amazing people.</p>
<p>Why can’t I recognize how lucky I’ve been?</p>
<p>How dangerous a thought it is to wish to be young again.</p>
<p>I suppose that’s the nature of reflection on life.</p>
<p>It’s always rushed and incomplete,</p>
<p>because life is neither done nor slowing down.</p>
<p>The reflection is either biased by hope or disillusionment.</p>
<p>The future is always present in a reflection.</p>
<p>Or at least I can’t find a way to eliminate it.</p>
<h2>Ephemeral Slow Rain.</h2>
<p>I cry, not from the pain, well not in the direct sense,</p>
<p>rather, I cry because I recognize the pain is temporary,</p>
<p>and the joy the pain will win, it too will be temporary.</p>
<p>All the things that make me happy,</p>
<p>share the share the fate of those that don't.</p>
<p>I've missed moments in moments</p>
<p>and sat back years later knowing I was right to miss it then.</p>
<p>and now, I don't just miss this moment,</p>
<p>I miss this youth, this youth I'm so afraid to lose,</p>
<p>because only youth keeps death back and then –</p>
<p>it so often doesn't.</p>
<p>So, we fixate, we focus,</p>
<p>we embrace evanescence and ephemerality,</p>
<p>and we do what we can to pause,</p>
<p>to extend moments,</p>
<p>to slow the rapidly faster clock.</p>
<p>We stare,</p>
<p>stare at the orange light that fills this world</p>
<p>and seems to do so at this time every year.</p>
<p>The image makes us think of things we've already thought,</p>
<p>and we hover for a moment,</p>
<p>but don't return to them,</p>
<p>they're gone to the time.</p>
<p>But still we look, now at the flower;</p>
<p>pedals white but embracing the light of the sun,</p>
<p>embracing the colour, it's being given, embracing its fate,</p>
<p>it's fickle nature, it’s inability not to embrace it.</p>
<p>All pedals lead back to plant.</p>
<p>At its centre, its core is yellow,</p>
<p>distinctly itself, but not untouched by fate.</p>
<p>The conjunction of temporal setting.</p>
<p>Below it, the green of the past holds it in its place.</p>
<p>The stem, the history, the foundation of a plant.</p>
<p>And yet she too spreads out with her own arms,</p>
<p>not recognizing that her time is gone, her purpose filled.</p>
<p>And then we sit back, and we realize,</p>
<p>we aren't the person looking at the flower,</p>
<p>at least not anymore.</p>
<p>Now we sit looking at our painting of the flower.</p>
<p>How it captures so little of the likeness</p>
<p>but is that cherished flower all the same.</p>
<p>And we think how in the depths of winter that flower must feel pain,</p>
<p>but the painting, the water and pigment, it too was dying.</p>
<p>It will outlast the flower,</p>
<p>it will outlast the painter,</p>
<p>the poet,</p>
<p>the pain,</p>
<p>the joy,</p>
<p>but it too is temporary.</p>
<p>And the poet and the painter and the little boy who loves flowers cry,</p>
<p>because they still haven't found eternity.</p>
<div class="figure">Figure 3.   The Horses</div>
<h2>Two Rivers Through Charlevoix QC.</h2>
<p>Slog. One foot. Slog. Next foot.</p>
<p>Slog. First foot. Slog. Next foot.</p>
<p>The rhythmic pattern that keeps you alive.</p>
<p>The pain that begs you to let it die.</p>
<p>The sun is your friend, but he is fickle.</p>
<p>And equally ephemeral.</p>
<p>And it dawned on you.</p>
<p>He’s leaving you.</p>
<p>The clarity of life.</p>
<p>The obvious path.</p>
<p>It all disappears</p>
<p>colours turn to shades of grey.</p>
<p>Signs point the wrong way.</p>
<p>So, you turn back,</p>
<p>But back isn’t the way.</p>
<p>And the pain builds.</p>
<p>But I won’t die here.</p>
<p>I didn’t fight this hard to die so close to life.</p>
<p>Day runs its course and night replaces it.</p>
<p>The mind is lost.</p>
<p>Night is so different then day.</p>
<p>But the pattern doesn’t change.</p>
<p>It’s one frozen foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>And so you move forward.</p>
<p>The dark hides everything the face wants to say.</p>
<p>You can’t see your father’s-tired eyes.</p>
<p>But you know.</p>
<p>You both know</p>
<p>so long as neither of you give in, you’ll make it.</p>
<p>You both know</p>
<p>how much you each want to give in.</p>
<p>You both know</p>
<p>You think about when you were a kid.</p>
<p>When the love in your heart convinced you</p>
<p>you could carry him 5 miles through the cold of winter.</p>
<p>And now you call it realism.</p>
<p>It would kill you both.</p>
<p>But still, you feel guilty,</p>
<p>As though somehow you love him less for the realism.</p>
<p>You read in a book once,</p>
<p>A mountain climber stuck in a crevasse,</p>
<p>His partner having done all he could.</p>
<p>Sleeps to the sound of his dying friend.</p>
<p>Your dad gave you this book.</p>
<p>“if you are serious about this,</p>
<p>You need to know the costs”.</p>
<p>Now you pray that it’s you that pays the cost.</p>
<p>Though that wouldn’t change a thing.</p>
<p>There’s beauty in the struggle of a day.</p>
<p>There’s no beauty in the struggle of night.</p>
<p>Night wipes the earth of its beauty,</p>
<p>in comparison to the sky.</p>
<p>You only think you are vast.</p>
<p>You think you understand time.</p>
<p>You think you live in the present.</p>
<p>In the presence of stars and people.</p>
<p>In the presence of other present things,</p>
<p>but here you are bathing in the light of dead stars,</p>
<p>playing back the memories of people you thought you knew.</p>
<p>Slogging away at a trail that’s already been cleared a hundred times.</p>
<p>Only this time, here I am.</p>
<p>The importance of the universe,</p>
<p>brushed aside with each snowflake.</p>
<p>That was a life,</p>
<p>not in our human conception,</p>
<p>but a life all the same.</p>
<p>That was a life.</p>
<p>That was a life.</p>
<p>They’re re still lives,</p>
<p>but what right did you have to influence them?</p>
<p>What right did you have to break the unity of snow</p>
<p>to cut rivers that time has spent so long repairing?</p>
<p>Filling in.</p>
<p>Only to be cut again.</p>
<p>With each step.</p>
<p>And the next.</p>
<p>Why can’t you resist the call?</p>
<p>What is it about this beautiful country</p>
<p>that calls you back again and again?</p>
<p>The country of your father,</p>
<p>And his father before him.</p>
<p>And the ideas of toughness built in this environ</p>
<p>That you’ve abandoned everywhere else but here.</p>
<p>Here, you suffer in silence.</p>
<p>Your country and your father,</p>
<p>his love for this place,</p>
<p>this place that looks like it might kill you.</p>
<p>But you’ve no choice,</p>
<p>That love is as much his as it is yours.</p>
<p>His love, that you adopted.</p>
<p>Your mother and the love she gave you.</p>
<p>It’s different in every way.</p>
