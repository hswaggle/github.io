All t he thi ngs t hat m ake me happy,

<div class="poem">it  so often doesn't. 
 
S o, we fixate, w e focus,
 
we embra ce evanes cen ce  and epheme rali ty, 
 
and we do wh at we c an t o pause, 
 
to extend mom ents, 
 
to sl ow the rapidl y faster clock. 
 
 
We star e,
 
stare at t he or ange li ght t hat fil ls t his world
 
and seems t o do so at t his t im e every ye ar. 
 
The im age makes us t hin k of things we've alr eady  thought ,

but don't  return to t hem, 
 
they're gone to t he ti me.
 
 
B ut st il l we look, now atthe flower; 
 
pedals whi te but embra ci ng the light  of the sun,
 
embracing t he colour, it 's being gi ven, embra cing i ts fate,
 
 
 
All pedals l ead ba ck to pl ant. 
 
At it s centre, it s core is y ell ow, 
 
dist inctly i tself, but not untouched by fate.
 
The conjunction of temp oral setti ng. 
 
Belowit, t he green of the  past holds it i n its place. 
 
The stem, t he hist ory, the  foundati on of a plant. 
 
And yet she too spre ads out  with her own arms, 
 
not recognizing that he r tim e is go ne, her purpose filled.</div>

And then we sit  back, an d we re ali ze, 
 
we ar en't t he person look ing at the flower, 
 
at l east not  anymore.
 
Now we sit  looki ng at our paint ing of the flowe r. 
 
How it  captures so l it tl e of the li keness
 
but i s that cherished flow er all  the same. 
 
And we thi nk how in the depths o f wint er that flo wer must feel p ain,
 
but t he paint ing, t he wate r and pigm ent, i t t oo was dyi ng. 
 
It wil l out last the flowe r, 
 
it  will  outl ast t he paint er, 
 
the poet, 
 
the pain,
 
the joy,
 
but i t t oo is temporary. 
 
 
And the poet and the p aint er and the lit tl e boy wh o loves flowers c ry, 
 
because th ey st il l haven't found eternit y.
