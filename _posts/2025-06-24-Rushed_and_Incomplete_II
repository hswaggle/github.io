Rushed and Incomplete II. 
The first flower, orange in orange.  
The hearty pedals shone bright tiger orange;  
they were almost cubic in stature.  
They didn’t overlap the way most flowers do. 
Each pedal was its own individual,  
desperately trying to be its own flower.  
Its own.  
Yet here it was,  
attached by the marigold arms of the core, 
pulled towards a collective consciousness.  
The marigold hands reached up.  
Those that didn’t hold the pedals clasped at something higher.  
Struggling to pull itself into the sun  
or struggling for something greater.  
At times the individualistic pedals and the core conflicted in their missions.  
The pedals stopped pulling away,  
crashing into each other and towards the core, 
preventing the core from completing its mission.  
By the time the pedals and the pistil realized they were synergistically bound,  
protecting one, feeding the other, they’d pulled away.  
Off to pull towards its individuality,  
and the pistil thinks to itself,  
“where did the time go?” 
and then she returns to her striving for ascension,  
an irony that is lost on the flower.
