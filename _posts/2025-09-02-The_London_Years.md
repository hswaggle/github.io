Growing up my walls we're blank. To protect the paint. The first bedroom I decorated was my mold infested london basement apartment. I plastered the walls with whatever I could get my hands on. Personal works, a triptych of blue nudes (Picasso, Matisse, Unnamed digital artist), a calendar of Audrey Hepburn, a dyptych of Black and White photos (the streets of manhattan and its visual twin - waves on a beach), a series of film photos taken by my sister 10 years prior, but most prominent were the countless cutouts from atlantic articles.  

My uncle gave me a subscription to the magazine after I'd torn through the incredible article [Double Blind](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/04/double-blind/304710/), which if you have not read is far more worthy of your time than what is to come. 

Even though at the time, I was merely looking for aestheticly pleasing images for decoration, the topicality of the actual articles and the art that supplemented them has allowed for a visual reminescence on the events that defined my years in London.

As I moved out, I tore the images from my walls. The paint often coming with, the images suffering tears and rips, the cost of having been permanently installed.

Upon my return home, filled with inspiration for a use for my torn up wall decor, I set to work.
