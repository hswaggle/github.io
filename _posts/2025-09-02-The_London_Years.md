Growing up my walls we're blank. To protect the paint. The first bedroom I decorated was my mold infested london basement apartment. I plastered the walls with whatever I could get my hands on. Personal works, a triptych of blue nudes (Picasso, Matisse, Unnamed digital artist), a calendar of audrey hepburn, a dyptych of BW photos (the streets of manhattan and its visual twin - waves on a beach), but most prominent were the countless cutouts from atlantic articles.  

My uncle gave me a subscription to the magazine after I'd torn through the incredible article [Double Blind](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/04/double-blind/304710/), which if you have not read is far more worthy of your time than what is to come. 

Even though at the time, I was merely looking for aestheticly pleasing images for decoration, the topicality of the actual articles and the art that supplemented them has allowed for a visual reminescence on the events that defined my years in London.

As I moved out, I tore the images from my walls. The paint often coming with, the images suffering tears and rips, the cost of having been permanently installed.
