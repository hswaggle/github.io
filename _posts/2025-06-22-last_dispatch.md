In my five years at Western University I generally submitted a poem to two competitions a year. One per semester. This collection is roughly a chronological presentation of the works written for competition. As is probably easy to understand, it is with some difficulty that I present these works in untouched form. 

The figures scattered throughout we're originally created for a series titled *dark drawings collection*. They we're an attempt to both intuitize the drawing process, training the key shapes into muscle memory, and create a drawing process without revision. In that latter theme I found a throughline to the re-presentation of the works herefound into a collection - thus renamed *dispatch* *#* with some general correspondence of the faces (numbered left-to-right-down-left-to-right) and the poetic works. 

The other figure presented inline is titled *The Horses*, and was my very first foray into the digital medium. Largely a study of composition colour and digital toolings, it is extremely derivative of Vasily Kandinsky's *Blue Mountain* - the new title pays homage to this similiarity.

The Cover Art for the whole collection is probably the spiritual predecessor in the visual medium to this project. Made originally for the cover page of a friends essay on creativity, it was in essence a cleaning out of my digital drawer. Works and expirements from my forays into digital art are drawn and compiled together - with works sourced in her essay. 

In it's original presented form, [the collection](the last dispatch_final.pdf) is presented in pdf form here. The individual peoms can be found in the following posts.
