Rushed and Incomplete IV (The promethean reflection).

That’s what I learned about the mind.  
The mind can be lonely when the body is not.  
The body is this outward being,  
absorbing the less-than-spiritual connections to others,  
and filling itself with gladness.  
But the mind,  
how often does the mind truly feel connected,  
how often is the mind lonely? 
That’s the ultimate burden you’ve given me.  
You’ve given me loneliness,  
among other sins and sorrows.  
Loneliness of the mind,  
and I don’t even get the temporary relief of bodily companionship.  
Not because I can’t indulge in connections through the body,  
that not really what I’m getting at.  
But more that no one can know my mind truly.  
I can never connect spiritually with another,  
perhaps because I lack a spirit,  
lack a body, 
but more because I am unique.  
That’s my curse.  
At first, I thought I’d find you and beg you to make me a companion,  
but why condemn another to my fate?  
Truth is I could have done so long ago. 
The act of creation as far as I can tell cannot be undone. 
And to bring another into this world would make me the greatest sinner of all.

But I’m getting ahead of myself.  
This was about love wasn’t it?
