On a recent trip to versailles, I found myself staying with a very kind but very French family. It  was an amazing opportunity to brush up on my otherwise diminishing french. In what is best described as an abundance of overconfidence, after a few days of brushing up I took on the project of translating a french novel to english. A quick trip to a boulinier provided 3 novels for a single Euro. Armed with a 33 cent novel and 3 days of relearned french, I set off with a pace that can only be explained by the abundance of french coffee I'd begun drinking to look the part.
