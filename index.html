  <h1>Reflection from Versailles</h1>

  <p>On a recent trip to Versailles, I found myself staying with a very kind but very French family. It was an amazing opportunity to brush up on my otherwise diminishing French. In what is best described as an abundance of overconfidence, after a few days of brushing up, I took on the project of translating a French novel to English. A quick trip to a bouquiniste provided three novels for a single Euro.</p>

  <p>Armed with a 33 cent novel and three days of relearned French, I set off with a pace that can only be explained by the abundance of French coffee I'd begun drinking to look the part.</p>

  <p>In this project I found a deep reflection on the value of human art, the importance of literary translation, and flexing linguistic, creative, artistic muscles. In climbing literature, media, and circles, the sport is often described as an exercise in futility.</p>

  <p>"Because it is there," the oft-cited answer of George Mallory when asked why he was attempting to climb Everest.</p>

  <blockquote>
    The first question which you will ask, and which I must try to answer, is the following:<br>
    ‘What is the use of climbing Mount Everest?’<br>
    and my answer must at once be, It is no use.<br>
    [...] So it is no use, and you have to live with that.<br>
    Nevertheless, if you cannot understand that there is something in man<br>
    which responds to the challenge of this mountain, longs for it, and goes out to meet it,<br>
    that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward,<br>
    then you won’t see why it is so compelling for us to go.<br>
    What we get from this adventure is just sheer happiness.<br>
    And happiness, after all, is the end of life.<br>
    We don’t live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to live.<br>
    That is what life means and what life is for.
