On a recent trip to versailles, I found myself staying with a very kind but very French family. It  was an amazing opportunity to brush up on my otherwise diminishing french. In what is best described as an abundance of overconfidence, after a few days of brushing up I took on the project of translating a french novel to english. A quick trip to a boulinier provided 3 novels for a single Euro. Armed with a 33 cent novel and 3 days of relearned french, I set off with a pace that can only be explained by the abundance of french coffee I'd begun drinking to look the part. 

In this project I found a deep reflection on the value of human art, the importance of literary translation, and flexing linguistic, creative, artistic muscles. In climbing literature, media, and circles, the sport is often described as an excercise in futility. 

"Because it is there", the oft cited answer of George Mallory, when asked why he was attemptig to climb Everest. 


> The first question which you will ask, and which I must try to answer, is the following:
> ‘What is the use of climbing Mount Everest?’
> and my answer must at once be, It is no use.
There is not the slightest prospect of any profit whatsoever.
Oh, we may learn a little about the behaviour of the human body at high altitudes,
we willingly put the active capacity of our lungs to the test,
and possibly medical men may turn our observation
to some account for the purposes of aviation.
But otherwise nothing will come of it – neither positive nor negative.
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, not a gem, nor any coal or iron.
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food.
So it is no use, and you have to live with that.
Nevertheless, if you cannot understand that there is something in man
which responds to the challenge of this mountain, longs for it, and goes out to meet it,
that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward,
then you won’t see why it is so compelling for us to go.
What we get from this adventure is just sheer happiness.
And happiness, after all, is the end of life.
We don’t live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to live.
That is what life means and what life is for.
